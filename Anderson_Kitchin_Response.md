Anderson goes into detail on the idea that we are now entering a new era: The Petabyte Age. With how technology has grown recently, Anderson argues that all of the Big Data gathered is ruining the scientific method and research as we know it. He states how we no longer need to question or have theories as correlation is reason enough. Additionally, he uses Google as an example of how algorithms and machine learning no longer require high-level thinking. He talks about how the correlation between what a consumer buys and the advertisments put up is enough. On the other hand, Kitchin states that Big Data is pushing us into a new fourth paradigm. He states how Big Data isn't removing theories, but on the other hand the data is only adding to our knowledge in order to make the scientific method better and make research more advanced. While I agree with Anderson's example involving Google and how in that case correlation is enough, my beliefs tie closer to Kitchin's point of view on the matter. I think that our technological advances and collection of Big Data are only adding to our knowledge and can open a whole new world of thinking. I also agree that we have now shifted into a new paradigm. Children that grow up today have different relationships with technology than the generations above them. This new paradigm is causing the world to look at things from a different, more technological approach.
