## Problem Statement

DTP Vaccination rates are essential to the decrease of neonatal fatality and nine countries are left with less than 50 percent coverage. Ukraine is one of the nine countries with extremely low DTP vaccination rates and is under alert for being a country with poor immuinization provision, high infantile mortatlity, and lacking human development.

Thirteen standing countries exist that have yet to fully eliminate tetanus: a disease that is prevented from the DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) vaccine. This vaccine is used as a gauge for how vaccine-regulated countries around the world are. The DTP vaccine is used 86 percent globally with 112 countries meeting 90 percent utilization for the past three years. The use of the vaccine is crucial due to the incredibly high newborn fatality rate at 70 to 100 percent. Chad, Ukraine, and Somalia are three of the nine countries in existence to have less than 50 percent DTP vaccination coverage in their country. In line with Amartya Sen, the inability to receive this essential vaccination stems from the branches of unfreedoms he discussed: security and economics. The realm of easily accessible health care is tackled in this source, mentioning goals of increasing vaccination rates until there is 100 percent worldwide coverage. Many interactive maps, charts, and graphs present the data in an informative and clear cut way through the use of data science techniques such as visualization and descriptive statistics. The neonatal and infancy stages of human development are addressed as the vaccine contributes predominately to newborn children. Through the gathering and publishing of this data, authors are tackling the scientific question of whether global vaccination rates will be raised so that children, especially in non-vaccinated areas, will be able to live rather than being healthcare-neglected.
